## The PADS

Generate the following two result sets:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

There are total [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(Name, '(', LEFT(Occupation, 1), ')')
FROM OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY Name;

SELECT CONCAT('There are total ', COUNT(Occupation), ' ', LOWER(Occupation), 's.')
FROM OCCUPATIONS
GROUP BY Occupation
ORDER BY COUNT(Occupation), Occupation;
```
